I tested several model candidates, and at the end decided to use the following 3 for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression: \n",
    " - Logistic regression is a statistical technique of modeling a binomial outcome (0 or 1, in our case passing or failing a course) with one or more explanatory variables. In logistic regression, given class labels \\\\(y\\\\) and a corresponding feature set \\\\(X\\\\), we aim to find a weight matrix \\\\(W\\\\) such that the difference between the class labels and \\\\( sig( WX) \\\\) is minimized. \\\\(sig\\\\) is the sigmoid function and the product \\\\( WX \\\\) is also refered as activation. We then interpret \\\\( sig( WX) \\\\) as class probabilities and threshold it (usually at 0.5) to indicate probability of the feature set belonging to a particular class. Logistic regression assumes that there is a single decision boundary and the data set is linearly separable and is less prone to overfitting. Logistic regression has been applied to predict outcomes in several real-world problems. For example, logistic regression was applied to predict [bankruptcy in the hospitality industry](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=jhfm) using the financial data of 16 U.S. hospitality firms that went bankrupt between 1999 and 2004 and 16 non-bankrupt matching firms.  The logistic regression models could correctly predict 91% and 84% of bankruptcy cases 1 and 2 years earlier, respectively. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Advantage: One advantage of using logistic regression is that in addition to providing predictions, it also gives how certain the model is of that prediction. This helps identify regions where the model is not sure of the prediction. Other advantage is that the predictor variables can be dichotomous, ordinal, or continuous. Another advantage is that the logistic regression provides a quantitative estimate of the strength of the association adjusting for other variables (removes confounding effects). The exponential of coefficients correspond to odd ratios for the given factor, therefore relative importance of each feature can be estimated. Logistic regression works better if there is a single decision boundary. Further,as logistic regression assumes a simple underlying model, it is less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Disadvantage: In cases where there are several independent factors or predictor/explanatory variables, enough data with each possible combination of predictor/explanatory is required. Using interaction or adding factors that are rare can result in overfitting, and degrade model's generalizability. Logistic regression assumes that there is a single decision boundary and the data set is linearly separable, however, this need not be true, and this assumption can result in poor classification. Further, although logistic regression allows for using ordinal data, in many applications the underlying linearity assumption between the ordinal predictors and outcome measure need not be valid. If we use coefficients of linear regression to draw inferences about relative importance of each feature, then some sort of feature scaling is required so the features are of the same order. This introduces additional preprocessing step and can adversely affect the scalability of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    " - Why use this model:  Logistic Regression is a good candidate for this data set because it is simple and is less prone to overfitting. Further, in addition to providing class predictions, it gives probability scores that are interpretted as faith of the model in the prediction. It also gives relative importance of each predictor. One limitation is lack of sufficient data. There are a total of 48 predictor variables, and only 395 training points. Even if we assume 2 levels for each of the 48 variables, we get a total \\\\(2^48\\\\) combinations, therefore there is not sufficient data to account for all possible combinations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decision tree learning:\n",
    " - Decision tree: A decision tree is a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps features or predictor/explanatory variables to outcome variable. Decision tree learning partitions the feature space into different regions and assigns a class to each of the regions. A typical decision tree is implemented in two steps, first a 'best' split is obtained. This is typically achieved by splitting the data by individual feature and testing how well that feature alone explains the data. Most common splitting criteria are gini impurity which minimizes misclassification rate, entropy (or information gain) which splits data so the uncertainity in class predictions in each tree reduces.  The feature that shows highest predictive power is chosen to split upon. This process is repeated on the resulting subtrees and continued until there is no data left to split or some stopping criteria is met. Decision trees are very versatile and easy to use, and hence have found applications in several areas. For example, decision trees were used to build a [stock portfolio optimization](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~s255khan/files/finance_ICISTM_final_2007.pdf) algorithm.\n",
    "  - Advantage: As decision trees make no underlying assumptions about the nature of data or its distribution, it is not prone to errors due to these assumptions. Therefore nonlinearities or skewed data distributions can easily be handled by decision trees. As the splits of features is based on minimizing misclassifiaction rates or maximizing information gain, decision trees inherently screen and select variables that are important for the classification problem. Therefore, features that do not provide any information or help in classifying data may never be used for prediction. More importantly, as data is split based on the values of individual features taken one at a time, there is no need to preprocess data, therefore decision trees are easy to scale up. As decision trees do not require specialized math or complex algorithms, they are easy to implement, understand and explain.  \n",
    " - Disadvantage: The main disadvantage of decision trees is that without proper pruning or limiting tree growth, they can easily overfit the training data. As trees are split based on one feature, they tend to ignore other correlated features, where as other algorithms will weigh in both the correlated features. Decision trees are very sensitive to data, and a small variation in data can result in a very different decision tree. Further, there are no probabilistic or statistical techniques (F-test, p-value, etc) that quantify how good the model fit is. A minor disadvantage is that decision trees assume that decision boundaries are functions of one variable alone, this results in decision boundaries that are parallel to axis of at least one feature. \n",
    " - Why use this model:  Decision trees are insensitive to nonlinearity and skewness, both of which are expected to be present in our data set. Decision tress inherently split data based on features that provide the most information, therefore, features that are do not provide information are not used. Decision trees are easy to implement and relatively fast to compute, therefore, best parameter search over a wider grid can be performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adaboost:\n",
    " - Adaboost: AdaBoost or adaptive boosting is a meta-algorithm that can be used in conjunction with weak learners to improve their performance. Weighted sum of predictions from multiple weak algorithms is used to make predictions. The weights corresponding to individual weak learner are adapted in each iteration so the models that make greater errors contribute more to the overall error. Therefore, in the next iteration the algorithm improved the performances in areas where more errors are made. Repeating this step successively results in an algorithm that combines predictions from several weak classifiers to give a strong classifier. \n",
    " - Advantage: As adaboost combines multiple weak learners, it is simple and easy to implement. It is flexible as it can be combined with any weak learner without requiring any knowledge or information about the weak learner. As adaboost combines multiple weak learners, the goal of user shifts from finding the best algorithm to finding an algorithm that performs better than chance (0.5). As adaboost is built upon weaker learners, it inherits all the advantages of the underlying weak learner. For example, adaboost algorithm with decision trees as weak learners inherits all the advantages of it, and alleviates some of the disadvantages of the decision trees. As the structure of decision trees are sensitive to small variations in data, combining multiple of them gives a model that is insensitive to the structure of the trees. Similarly, adaboost or other ensemble methods have the potential to take into account multiple features (via different decision trees) to alleviate the issue that decision trees make splits based on one variable alone. As adaboost combines multiple weak learners, it is in general less prone to overfitting. Further, the decision boundaries need not be parallel to individual features' axes. \n",
    " - Disadvantage: Adaboost combines multiple weak learners, therefore a poor weak learner can adversely affect its performance. If the underlying weak learner is too complex, then there is a chance of overfitting, and if its too weak, underfitting. \n",
    " - Why use this model: Adaboost technique combines multiple weak learners to give a strong model. In this project, adaboost is used with decision trees. This assures that the underlying models are less prone to overfitting, are not adversely affected by nonlinearities or skewed distributions. In addition using adaboost in conjunction with decision trees reduces sensitivity of the predictor model to data, and by combining different trees allows for multiple correlated features to used to make splits."

    "Three models (logistic regression, decision tree and adaboost) were tested. Training data points were split into three training and validation sets such that the number of training points in the training set were 100, 200 and 300, respectively. Tables above present training times, prediction times, f1-score during training and f1-score during testing. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it combines both precision and recall into a single metric. Maximizing F1-scores typically gives higher precision and recall. Comparing across models, F1-scores on training set were highest for the decision tree model and adaboost, followed by the logistic regression. These scores however did not transfer to the testing set. On testing data, logistic regression performed the best followed by adaboost and decision trees. This indicates that the decision trees overfit the data, and proper pruning is required. Adaboost showed better performance than decision trees. This is not surprising given adaboost's tendency to not overfit data and provide stable predictions. Finally logistic regression showed the best performance, however, logistic regression scores cannot be further improved without introducing regularization terms. Therefore, logistic regression was not chosen. For all the models, transfer from training to testing set was the best when 200 points were taken for training. Transfer or generalization was poor when models were trained on 100 or 300 points. Too few training points result in poor coverage and too many training points can result in test data being too sparse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results I chose the adaboost algorithm. Adaboost algroithm is slightly more complex than decision tree model. However, it removes several decision trees' disadvantages like overfitting, high sensitivity to data, tendency to use only one feature to perform splitting and ignoring correlated variables, and large variation in structure of trees. Although, adaboost model may be slower when more estimators are involved, the advantages offered by adaboost overweigh potentially longer training time. Further, the predictions times are expected to be in the order of milliseconds. So having longer training time for better performance is a prudent choice."

    "AdaBoost or adaptive boosting is applied in conjunction with decision trees. Adaboost weighs multiple weak learners (decision trees), and combines their predictions to give an enseamble prediction. Decision tree learning partitions the predictor variables into different regions and makes predictions for each class. Advantage of decision trees is that they make no underlying assumption about the data and provide intuitive interprations. However, a poorly designed decision tree is prone to not generalizing to new data, not considering multiple correlated variables and high variance in tree structures. These issues can be alleviated by using an adaboost model on top of decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training the model, first the data was split into 300 training data set and 95 test data. Two parameters of decision trees (maximum depth of a tree and minimum number of samples to make decision at each node) and two parameters of adaboost (number of estimators and learning rate) were varied. To keep track of training, I sampled 1 value of maximum depth, minimum number of samples and number of estimators from a discrete distribution of integers. I sampled 1 value in the initialy for the learning rate from a uniform distribution, and sampled more values as training progressed. The main idea was to throw a wider and conduct search over larger range, and restrict the range as training progresses. The training algorithm samples these parameters, and keeps track of the parameters that give the best performance. As training progresses, algorithm seeks samples parameters from a narrower range around the best set of parameters. Iterative parameter search was performed instead of gridsearch over a large grid because performing training in an iterative manner allows to monitor the training process and make any corrections if needed. Further [random search usually gives better performance](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) for the same number of training sets when compared to grid search. This process is repeated until the performance on the test data converges. Once the best model is obtained, predictions are made by first making predictions from individual decision trees, and then using adaboost to combine all predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further improve performance and stability of predicitons, all good model candidates (defined by F1-score above 0.81) are used in a final voting classifier. This step usually gives 1-2% boost in performance. "
